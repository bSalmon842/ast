/////////////////////////////////////
16APR2022

- All debug vis is now broken as we are in the middle of a debug restructure
/////////////////////////////////////
15APR2022

- Reworked Render Entry sorting again, now sorts an array of RenderEntry_Headers which is then used in the renderer instead of the pushbuffer memory
- Continued debug overhaul, now includes the platform layer, frame segment bars are currently broken
/////////////////////////////////////
14APR2022

/////////////////////////////////////
11APR2022

- Fixed broken build from halfway-done debug refactor
- Change Camera.pos to a Rect3f so that UI can access the Camera dims
- Added parameter in the font packing in the asset builder to allow different font sizes
- Made debug timed scopes thread-safe
- Added separate path for orthographic render positioning
- Added Rect behind debug info to see the info a bit easier
- Cleaned up some old redundant debug code from the platform layer (Console FPS printing, HandleCycleCounter)
- Continued work on debugging infrastructure, including specific debug memory, rolling data buffer, and min/max/ave metrics
/////////////////////////////////////
10APR2022

- Made emitters be stored in Game_State as an array, changed InitialiseEmitter to AddEmitter
- Added Bitmap Support to Emitters and Particles, Emitters hold a selection of BitmapIDs, one of which is passed to a particle

- Removed Debug File reading functions from platform layer and PlatformAPI
- Started work on new debugging tools (ast_debug.h)
/////////////////////////////////////
08APR2022

- Added zLayer to Push functions, which allows entries with the same z coord to be sorted in front or behind one another
- Added particle count to Emitter and InitialiseEmitter to change how many particles an Emitter can output at once
- Moved values in the Emitter relating to universal start and end progression out to EmitterProgressionInfo
- Added basic particle collision with entities which is enabled through the emitter
/////////////////////////////////////
07APR2022

- Removed EmitterShapeType and replaced with EmitterShapeInfo, which holds any info regarding the shape of the emission
- Added base to EmitterShapeInfo to accomodate cylinder shape emissions
- Added initial and end colours to Emitter to allow particles to colour lerp
- Got rid of Bubble Sort, Render Entries now sort themselves at push-time
- Added sortZ and entrySize to RenderEntry_Header to help sorting
